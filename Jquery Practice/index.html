<h1>Through the Looking-Glass</h1>
<div class="author">by Lewis Carroll</div>
<div class="chapter" id="chapter-1">
    <h2 class="chapter-title">1. Looking-Glass House</h2>
    <p>There was a book lying near Alice on the table,
        and while she sat watching the White King (for she
        was still a little anxious about him, and had the
        ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted
        again), she turned over the leaves, to find some
        part that she could read,

        <span class="spoken">
            for it's all in some language I don't know,"
        </span>

        she said to herself.</p>
    <p>It was like this.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <h3 class="poem-title">YKCOWREBBAJ</h3>
        <div class="poem-stanza">
            <div>sevot yhtils eht dna ,gillirb sawT'</div>
            <div>ebaw eht ni elbmig dna eryg diD</div>

            <div>ebargtuo shtar emom eht dnA</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>She puzzled over this for some time, but at last
        a bright thought struck her. <span class="spoken">
"Why, it's a Looking-glass book, of course! And if
I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the
right way again."</span></p>
    <p>This was the poem that Alice read.</p>

    <p>Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
        on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty,
        and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
        equal.
    </p>

    <p>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
        that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
        can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of
        that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
        field as a final resting-place for those who here gave
        their lives that the nation might live. It is altogether
        fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a
        larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
        we cannot hallow, this ground.
